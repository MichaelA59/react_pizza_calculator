# React Pizza Calculator

I wanted to make a super quick app using React, so here it is.
A simple calculator for ordering pizza based on people attending your event.
Depending on the amount of people attending, you will be prompted with either 

1. A calculation
2. Mockery

# Setup

run `bundle install`

then, in another tab, `npm install` 

then `rails s` in one tab and `npm start` in the other

got to `localhost:3000`

or check it out on Heroku all set up
